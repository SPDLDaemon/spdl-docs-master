# The SPDL Docs Repository

Welcome to the SPDL Docs Repository!

This is a work in progress, and is intended to eventually serve as a repository for SPDL-curated best practices, tools, and tips.

If you feel extra motivated to write a whitepaper on a topic, you can clone the Github repository, add the page, and make a pull request for SPDL Daemon to review.
In this case, you may find the linked documentation at the lower left to be helpful when adding your page.
This site is built using Hugo, with the Learn theme.
